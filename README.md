# Name Generator Crate

Crate for generating random names for characters. This isn't creating names from scratch, but rather
getting a forename/surname pair from a weighted list at random. This crate is intended for use in my
personal game dev projects, specifically in Bevy, but I'm going to try to make it as generic as
possible, as well as engine-agnostic.
